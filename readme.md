## Basic html markup
~~~html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
~~~
Most of the html tag comes with pair. I mean it has opening tag and closing tag. only difference between opening and closing tag is, in closing tag we `</` instead of `<`.    
Whatever things we are seeing in a webpage it actually written in between `body` tag.   
### some common html tag
* html
* h1 ~ h6
* title
* body
* p
* ul
* ol
* li
* table
* tr
* th / td
* img 
* a 
* form
* label
* input

### attributes and value of  html tag 
most of html tag comes with attribute and value. suppose in case `img` we need `src` attribue in order to specify path of the image file.
~~~html
<img src="hello.png">
~~~
here `src` is `attribute` and `hello.png` is `value` for `src` attribute
